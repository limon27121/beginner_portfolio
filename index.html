          Hi, I am <strong> Md.Mooontaser Alam</strong>, studying at a
          <b> United International University</b> in Bangladesh. I completed my
          bachelor's degree in dept of computer science and engineering. I am
          currently doing my thesis, which topic is Biomedical image
          segmentation based on deep learning and Advanced machine learning. I
          am always interested in becoming a good programmer because I want to
          be a software developer in a renowned company in Bangladesh or any
          other country. Currently, I am spending my whole time developing my
          skill and trying to manage an internship to prepare myself as a good
          developer.

        <h4>Become a software engineer</h4>
        <p class="middle-para">
          To become a software engineer, you will typically need to have a solid
          foundation in computer science and programming. Here are some general
          steps you can take to pursue this career path: First Develop a strong
          foundation in math and computer science: Software engineering is a
          highly technical field, so you will need to have a strong foundation
          in math and computer science. You can take courses in calculus, linear
          algebra, discrete mathematics, algorithms and data structures,
          computer organization, operating systems, and computer networks to
          build this foundation. Learn programming languages: Software engineers
          need to be proficient in at least one programming language, but it's
          beneficial to learn several. Common programming languages used in
          software engineering include Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, and Ruby.
          You can take courses online or at a local community college or
          university to learn these languages. Next Gain practical experience:
          Practice makes perfect, so it's important to gain practical experience
          in software engineering. You can work on personal projects, contribute
          to open-source projects, participate in hackathons, and pursue
          internships or co-op positions. You should Obtain a degree or
          certification: Many software engineering jobs require a bachelor's
          degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field.
          Alternatively, you can obtain a certification in software engineering,
          such as the Certified Software Development Professional (CSDP) offered
          by the IEEE Computer Society.

            A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both
            the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the
            parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end
            (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require
            different skill sets. I will try my best to conquer my dream as
            early as possible.

            The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding,
            especially when you are a fresher. From a comparatively plain
            sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive
            working environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell
            you that getting into the battleground is damn exciting. You get to
            learn technologies that you might have never heard of, learn stuff
            from the elites out there and the best of all; you feel important
            because your code and your effort matters to the company. The only
            problem is that you just donâ€™t become an integral part of a team
            overnight as you need to prove yourself. The only way to prove
            yourself is by your work, and the only way to get the work done is
            to learn all that you can. You will gradually realize that it is a
            process and being surrounded by people sharing common interests, you
            are most likely to find this transition easier than it initially
            seemed to be.
